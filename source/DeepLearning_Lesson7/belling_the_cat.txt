Clock inaccuracies occur due to certain instabilities inherent in source oscillators and environmental conditions such as temperature, air circulation and mechanical stresses. The clocks in the different nodes need to be synchronized to limit the inaccuracies and hence implement the objectives of distributed system in an efficient manner. Hence, clock skew and drifts which forms the major source of clock inaccuracy needs to be monitored continuously. In certain applications it is not just enough to synchronize the various processes but also the various events that constitute them. This is called intra process synchronization. Intra process concurrency is captured by relation affects or causally affects. Bit matrix clocks and hierarchical clocks which evolved after the logical and vector clocks of Lamport capture affects relation between events of process. However both have a major disadvantage in terms of increased storage and communication overhead. Difference clocks captures intra process and inter process concurrency, at the same time with reduced storage and communication overheads.
